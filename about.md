## Short story

Back in time. It's 2012. I'm a software engineer participating at a contest
about cold start problem in movie recommender systems. Zero knowledge about
probabilities, statistics or machine learning. Solving the problem with bare
hands without reading nothing on the topic was an unstoppable trap. The contest
held a year, quarterly prizes. I won enough money to buy books to learn
about those topics. Soon, I discovered that many of my imaginations and systems
lied there in those books, analyzed by admirable people. Many other admirable
people buried their years in libraries and systems which tackles data adventures.

Many books and libraries after, I started to collect my own implementations 
into what is now named rapaio. Write and rewrite many times, to find better
tools, useful into those great data quests out there. Into this quests I would 
like to invite you too. Some of you already have done timid steps. 
I am thankful for that. Still, it's plenty of space. You are welcomed.
 
There are no rules because we are still small in number. We can talk 
to each other. If we feel the need for rules, we will create them. 
Until then, you can follow your feelings, common sense and regards each 
of us deserves.
