    "\n",
    "Reading and writing CSV files is an important feature for any system which works with data. The reason for its importance is the simplicity of the file format and its popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapaio library offers support for both reading and writing operations. It has a lot of features and allows flexibility. However we read a file only into a data frame, and we write a csv file only from a data frame. This might look like a constraint in the beginning, but it comes natural since both are tabular data. The only difference is the fact that one operates in the memory of a program and the other one is persisted on disk.\n",

    "#### Simple read/write data frames from/into Csv files\n",
    "\n",
    "We can read a file with the default options simply by instantiating a `rapaio.io.Csv` object and calls one of `read` methods."
