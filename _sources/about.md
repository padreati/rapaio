## Short story

Back in time. It's 2012. I'm a software engineer participating at a contest
about cold start problem in movie recommender systems. Zero knowledge about
probabilities, statistics or machine learning. Solving the problem with bare
hands without reading nothing on the topic was an unstoppable trap. The contest
held a year, quarterly prizes. I won enough money to buy books to learn
about those topics. Soon, I discovered that many of my imaginations and systems
lied there in those books, analyzed by admirable people. Many other admirable
people buried their years in libraries and systems which tackles data adventures.

Many books and libraries after, I started to collect my own implementations 
into what is now named rapaio. Write and rewrite many times, to find better
tools, useful into those great data quests out there. Into these quests I would 
like to invite you too. Some of you already have done timid steps. 
I am thankful for that. Still, it's plenty of space. You are welcomed.
 
There are no rules because we are still few in number. We can talk 
to each other. If we feel the need for rules, we will create them. 
Until then, you can follow your feelings, common sense and respect each 
of us deserves. 

## About me

I spent many years doing what I love: learning and solving problems.
I am among the few lucky ones who have a native curiosity to learn how 
things works. The process of understanding gives me a hard to define feeling 
of joy, and I am an addict. 

Someone once told me: "In this world there are composers who create worlds, 
there are virtuoso interprets who gave life to those worlds, and then 
there's us, the ones who are good at listening. We play a role, since 
without us their music values nothing." 

I strive to be a good listener and I do that for a selfish purpose:
to live upon myself the wonders many brilliant mind created for us.
The main purpose of this project is to learn and experiment. If it is 
useful for anybody else would also be great. I enjoy to share those small
things that I learned.
