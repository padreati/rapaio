*** WARNING ***

The local copy of your roaming profile,
stored in C:\Documents and Settings\raand,
is currently larger than your profile quota setting.

Profile quota = 10485760 bytes
Current profile size = 3181769 bytes

This may cause your personalized settings (such as e-mail
preferences, desktop and start menu settings) to become corrupt,
when you log off. In extreme cases, your settings may fail to save
altogether, causing you to lose personalized settings the
next time you log on.

A large local profile may also cause logging on and off to
become slower than normal.

To resolve this, you should delete some large files from
your local profile, or move them into your home directory
(drive h:). Before you log off A list of the 5 largest files
and 5 largest folders in your profile is shown below:

The largest files in your local profile are:
