/**
 * The Hyperbolic Tangent Kernel is also known as the Sigmoid Kernel and as
 * the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) kernel. The Sigmoid Kernel comes from the
 * Neural Networks field, where the bipolar sigmoid function is often used as
 * an activation function for artificial neurons.
 * <p>
 * k(x, y) = \tanh (\alpha x^T y + c)
 * <p>
 * It is interesting to note that a SVM model using a sigmoid kernel function
 * is equivalent to a two-layer, perceptron neural network. This kernel was
 * quite popular for support vector machines due to its origin from neural
 * network theory. Also, despite being only conditionally positive definite,
 * it has been found to perform well in practice.
 * <p>
 * There are two adjustable parameters in the sigmoid kernel, the slope alpha
 * and the intercept constant c. A common value for alpha is 1/N,
 * where N is the data dimension.
 * <p>
 * A more detailed study on sigmoid kernels can be found in the
 * works by Hsuan-Tien and Chih-Jen.
