 * of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
 * submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 * cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
 * Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
 * patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
 * for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 * 4. Redistribution.
 *
 * You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof

 * attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
 * that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
 * following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
 * Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
 * with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
 * Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
 * the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
 * License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
 * You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
 * provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
 * modifying the License.
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
 * additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
 * distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
 * provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
 * with the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 * 5. Submission of Contributions.
 *
 * Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
 * for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and

 * contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
 * and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 * liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
 * or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
 * out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
 * damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
 * any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
 * been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 * 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
 *
 * While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
 * offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
 * other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
 * in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
