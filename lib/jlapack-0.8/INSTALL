JLAPACK 0.8 Installation

All you need to do to get started with JLAPACK is set your CLASSPATH.

The following directions are for Solaris (using csh).  Other UNIX platforms 
should be very similar.  MS-DOS and Windows users should consult their JDK
documentation to find out how to set the CLASSPATH.

If your CLASSPATH environment variable is already set, append the following
files to it:

  $JLAPACK_HOME/f2jutil.jar
  $JLAPACK_HOME/blas.jar
  $JLAPACK_HOME/lapack.jar
  $JLAPACK_HOME/xerbla.jar

where JLAPACK_HOME represents the full path of the directory where you have
JLAPACK installed.

You may omit lapack.jar if you only plan to call BLAS routines, however
the others should always be used.

If you plan to use the simplified interfaces, you will need to add the
corresponding jar files to your CLASSPATH:

  $JLAPACK_HOME/blas_simple.jar -- for the simplified BLAS interface
  $JLAPACK_HOME/lapack_simple.jar -- for the simplified LAPACK interface

 For example, if your jlapack directory is /users/bob/jlapack/ the following
command would append the appropriate files to your CLASSPATH:
  
  % setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH":/users/bob/jlapack/f2jutil.jar:/users/bob/jlapack/blas.jar:/users/bob/jlapack/lapack.jar:/users/bob/jlapack/xerbla.jar"

If your CLASSPATH has not been set, you should set it to include the 
current directory as well as the jar files previously mentioned.
For example:

  % setenv CLASSPATH .:/users/bob/jlapack/f2jutil.jar:/users/bob/jlapack/blas.jar:/users/bob/jlapack/lapack.jar:/users/bob/jlapack/xerbla.jar

There are several basic test files in the $JLAPACK_HOME/examples subdirectory.
To verify that your CLASSPATH is properly set, attempt to build one of them
without using the Makefile.  For example:

  % javac DdotTest.java

If it compiles without any errors, try running it:

  % java DdotTest
  Answer = 36.3

If DdotTest.java will not compile, double-check the CLASSPATH setting
and the location of the class files.  Take a look at the Makefile for
an example of setting up the CLASSPATH.
